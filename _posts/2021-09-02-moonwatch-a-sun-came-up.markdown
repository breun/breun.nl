Today my band [Moonwatch](https://moonwatch.band) released a video for our new song 'A Sun Came Up'.
This song is taken off our upcoming second EP 'Kármán Line', which will be released later this month.
If you [sign up for the Moonwatch newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/moonwatch) we'll let you know when it's out.

Here's the video:
