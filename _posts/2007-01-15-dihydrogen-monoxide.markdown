<blockquote><h2>What are some of the dangers associated with DHMO?</h2>

Each year, Dihydrogen Monoxide is a known causative component in many thousands of deaths and is a major contributor to millions upon millions of dollars in damage to property and the environment. Some of the known perils of Dihydrogen Monoxide are:

<ul>
<li>Death due to accidental inhalation of DHMO, even in small quantities.</li>
<li>Prolonged exposure to solid DHMO causes severe tissue damage.</li>
<li>Excessive ingestion produces a number of unpleasant though not typically life-threatening side-effects.</li>
<li>DHMO is a major component of acid rain.</li>
<li>Gaseous DHMO can cause severe burns.</li>
<li>Contributes to soil erosion.</li>
<li>Leads to corrosion and oxidation of many metals.</li>
<li>Contamination of electrical systems often causes short-circuits.</li>
<li>Exposure decreases effectiveness of automobile brakes.</li>
<li>Found in biopsies of pre-cancerous tumors and lesions.</li>
<li>Given to vicious dogs involved in recent deadly attacks.</li>
<li>Often associated with killer cyclones in the U.S. Midwest and elsewhere, and in hurricanes including deadly storms in Florida, New Orleans and other areas of the southeastern U.S.</li>
<li>Thermal variations in DHMO are a suspected contributor to the El Nino weather effect.</li>
