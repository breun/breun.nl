title: Moonwatch album release show January 27th, 2024
---

At the end of May and early June this year, my band [Moonwatch](https://moonwatch.band) recorded 8 songs with [JJJ Sielcken](https://jjjsielcken.com) in his studio in Den Dolder.
We were already very pleased with this foundation of live takes, and recorded some additional parts in Studio Pingu√Øn (my home studio) and the bunker where we rehearse. 
The resulting album will be called _Myriad Eyes \ Myriad Other_, and will be released in January 2024.

To celebrate this first full-length Moonwatch album, we've teamed up with our friends from [Thistle Sifter](https://www.thistlesifter.com) for a double album release show at De Nijverheid on Saturday January 27th, 2024.
It's going to be a dreamy, gazey, spacey and rocking night.
We'll publish a first music video soon!
