In 2023 my band [Moonwatch](https://moonwatch.band) recorded 8 songs with [JJJ Sielcken](https://jjjsielcken.com) in his studio in Den Dolder.
And today we had a sold-out release show at De Nijverheid in Utrecht, together with our friends from [Thistle Sifter](https://www.thistlesifter.com)! 

Check out the video for LÅ«men:

I'm pretty proud of this record.
It's spacey, it's moody, it's vibey, it's joyful and at some point in Disorder we strip the paint from your walls.
