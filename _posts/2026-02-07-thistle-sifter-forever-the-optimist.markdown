title: Thistle Sifter - Forever the Optimist
---

I joined [Thistle Sifter](https://thistlesifter.com) at the end of 2024, because Pete was looking for a new guitarist.
Cinematic post-rock is right up my alley, and I enjoyed touring the Netherlands and Germany with them last year a lot.

(Don't worry, I'm still playing with my band [Moonwatch](https://moonwatch.band) as well.)

Last year, recording sessions for the third Thistle Sifter album started and I joined them to record additional guitar parts for the first two singles: [One Fleeting Glance](https://youtu.be/D7F-zEFDavQ) and [Ghost Acres](https://youtu.be/ceEUDpjDLvw).
