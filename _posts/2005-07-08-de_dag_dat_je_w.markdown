Na een week zingen de heren van <a href="http://www.radioanderson.com/">Anderson</a> in een hoekje van mijn hoofd nog steeds The Day You Left:

<blockquote>

You left me today with a tear on my cheek
I don't understand
Your jacket still hanging over mine
It takes time, it takes time

Stare at the door you've passed through before
Still feel the warmth of your face
Reach out my hands to hold you again
I close my eyes to see

You are there in my sleep and you're smiling back at me
And we spend some quiet time in the corner of my mind

Remember the night we counted the stars one by one
One by one
We talked and we talked 'til the sun hit the sky
I woke up, you were gone

Stare at the door you've passed through before
Still hear you saying goodbye
Reach out my hands to hold you again
Whisper your name and weep

You are there in my sleep and you're smiling back at me
And we spend some quiet time in the corner of my mind

</blockquote>
