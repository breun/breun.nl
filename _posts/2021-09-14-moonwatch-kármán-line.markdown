title: Moonwatch - Kármán Line
---

Today my band [Moonwatch](https://moonwatch.band) released its second EP, called **Kármán Line**.
It's more space, and more float.
You can find it on your favorite streaming platform ([Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/7HHeGaCByOzikGXhHjE3BQ), [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/nl/album/kármán-line-ep/1585872780), etc.).
If you'd like to download the EP, you can get it from [Bandcamp](https://moonwatch.bandcamp.com/album/k-rm-n-line) (pay what you want) or the iTunes Store.

Or you can listen to it right here:
