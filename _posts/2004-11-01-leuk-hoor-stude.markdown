<i>Geo-referencing of remotely sensed images may follow the approach of ortho-image generation by photogrammetric rectification, as shown in Figure 3.9. However, unless perspective displacement due to terrain undulation is significant for a chosen scale of mapping, many remotely sensed images can be rectified using polynomials linking the image with ground coordinates of a few GCPs.</i>
