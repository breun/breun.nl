Van de <a href="http://www.loosechange911.com/">officiÃ«le Loose Change website</a>:

<blockquote>This is where you'll find all the information you need on Loose Change, the independent documentary that has grown from a cult following to a grassroots organism that can no longer be contained.

The central premise of Loose Change is that the United States Government was, at the very least, criminially negligent in allowing the attacks of September 11th, 2001 to occur.

However, when one looks deeper into the evidence, one might come to the startling conclusion that our own government might have been directly responsible for the attacks themselves.

Loose Change merely scratches the surface of information that points to a massive government cover-up regarding 9/11. We highly encourage you to take it upon yourself to research the events of 9/11 for yourself and come to your own conclusions.

Loose Change is currently in two editions, with a third being developed for American theaters, intended to be released in 2007.

Ik heb de film nog niet helemaal gezien, maar er is in ieder geval een hoop te zien dat een beetje lijkt te rammelen aan 9/11. Voor de liefhebbers is er ook een <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1590675314105139271&q=loose+change">Nederlands ondertitelde versie</a>.
