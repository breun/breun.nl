"Pop picking is a fast 'n' furious business. <a href="http://www.bauer-plaza.com/">Bauer</a> were once described by an American reviewer, curiously echoing Cold War rhetoric, as giving 'more bang for your guilder'. Time has moved on: the very much contemporary <i>Baueresque</i> imparts more ping for your euro.

Any pigeon-holes are best set sensibly aside. Award winners and chart contenders, Bauer employ a fusion of styles, the ears catching a tantalising musical hotchpotch, distinctly original and yet echoing an astistic and epochal divergency from pre-rock to now, with Broadway, Hollywood and Hilversum simmering in the pot.

<i>Baueresque</i> reveals new dimensions to this aural ancestry. The melodic structure is embellished by lyrics that bewitch and bewilder, and underpinned by a distinctive keyboard sound. Several banks of them are wedged into Bauer's broom-cupboard studio in Amsterdam.

This is the third album from the delightful queasy-listening combo. It's the past, the present and the future, all in one disc.

Press to play and let go."
