<p>Na mijn repeat-verslaving aan dat nummer van Athelete <a href="http://breun.homeip.net/blog/archives/000045.html">laatst</a>, zijn nu <a href="http://www.subpop.com/bands/shins/">The Shins</a> met het nummer "New Slang" aan de beurt. Aldus een review was dit nummer de enige albumtrack enige die echt de moeite waard was, maar dat is 'ie dan dus ook.</p>

<div style="font-style:italic;font-size:x-small;">
<p>Gold teeth and a curse for this town were all in my mouth<br />
Only I don't know how they got out, dear<br />
Turn me back into the pet I was when we met<br />
I was happier then with no mind-set</p>

<p>And if you'd took to me like a gull takes to the wind<br />
Well, I'd have jumped from my trees<br />
And I'd have danced like the king of the eyesores<br />
And the rest of our lives would have fared well</p>

<p>New slang when you notice the stripes<br />
The dirt in your fries<br />
Hope it's right when you die, old and bony<br />
Dawn breaks like a bull through the hall<br />
Never should have called<br />
But my head's to the wall and I'm lonely</p>

<p>And if you'd took to me like a gull takes to the wind<br />
Well, I'd have jumped from my trees<br />
And I'd have danced like the king of the eyesores<br />
And the rest of our lives would have fared well</p>

<p>Godspeed all the bakers at dawn<br />
May they all cut their thumbs<br />
And bleed into their buns 'till they melt away<br />
I'm looking in on the good life<br />
I might be doomed never to find<br />
Without a trust of flaming fields<br />
Am I too dumb to refine?</p>

<p>And if you'd took to me like a<br />
I'd have danced like the queen of the eyesores<br />
And the rest of our lives would have fared well</p></div>

<p>Maar dan moet je er dus wel het Beach Boys-achtige country-deuntje bij horen. Doen dus.</p>
