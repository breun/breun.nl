Net ontdekt via een link in de 3VOOR12 Nieuwsbrief: <a href="http://www.gemueseorchester.org/">The First Vienna Vegetable Orchestra</a>.

"The First Vienna Vegetable Orchestra plays music exclusively on vegetable instruments: carrots and cucumbers instead of guitars and drums. Or, with their new cd <a href="http://www.gemueseorchester.org/cd_e.htm">automate</a>, a cuke-o-phon and radish-marimba instead of laptop and sampler. The music presents a transfer of electronic music pieces and structures to the instruments of the vegetable garden. 

The First Viennese Vegetable Orchestra consists exclusively of vegetable-based instruments, although where necessary, additional kitchen utensils such as knives or mixers are employed. This creates an autonomous and totally novel type of sound which cannot be achieved with conventional musical instruments. Marinated sound ideas and canned listening habits beg for expansion! This music is a playful departure from the conventional way of looking at vegetables as mere means to still an appetite. The instruments are subsequently made into a soup so that the audience can then enjoy them a second time..."

En het klinkt nog best goed ook...
