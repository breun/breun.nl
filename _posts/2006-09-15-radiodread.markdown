Kent u de de <a href="http://www.easystar.com/allstars.html">Easy Star All-Stars</a>?

<blockquote>The Easy Star All-Stars are a collective family of some of the finest reggae musicians in the New York area. The band features a rotating cast drawn from a talented pool of players, meaning that every show has its own nuances and its own life. The masterminds behind the All-Stars are Easy Star musical director Michael Goldwasser (a.k.a. Michael G), his production partner Victor Axelrod (a.k.a. Ticklah), and his two Easy Star label partners Eric Smith and Lem Oppenheimer. These four were the team behind the album Dub Side of the Moon (2003), which was a complete reggae re-vision of Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon. That record has been locked on the Billboard charts for over 3 years.
<br /><br />
Three years later--while the album continues to register on the Billboard Reggae Catalog Chart--Easy Star is set to release their concert DVD, Dub Side of the Moon Live, on June 27, 2006. While over thirty musicians contributed to the Dub Side CD, the DVD finds a tight and crystallized live touring band. Following this release is Radiodread on Augst 22, 2006. The log awaited reggae version of Radiohead's OK Computer.</blockquote>

Ja, dat lees je goed ja. <i>The log (sic) awaited raggae version of Radiohead's OK Computer</i>! En je kan 'm momenteel zelfs beluisteren op de <a href="http://3voor12.vpro.nl/luisterpaal/">luisterpaal van 3VOOR12</a>.

(En als je dan toch op de luisterpaal bent kan je meteen even luisteren hoe slecht de nieuwe DJ Shadow plaat is...)
