title: Add a tap tempo connector to your Boss RE-20 Space Echo

![Modified Boss RE-20 units](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/breun/boss-re-20-external-tap-tempo-mod/main/images/RE-20%20units%20with%20external%20tap%20tempo%20mod.HEIC){: width="750" }

I love delay pedals.
I currently have five delay pedals on the pedal board for my band [Moonwatch](https://moonwatch.band), and I usually use multiple delay pedals simultaneously.

I've dreamed of being able to synchronize the tempo of my Boss RE-20 Space Echo, DOD Rubberneck and Electro-Harmonix Canyon delay pedals, but sadly the [Boss RE-20](https://www.boss.info/global/products/re-20/) doesn't have a tap tempo connector.
I tried the newer [Boss RE-202](https://www.boss.info/global/products/re-202/), because it does have a tap tempo connector, I just prefer the sound and general simplicity of the RE-20.

And then I found posts on Reddit from people who had added a tap tempo connector themselves!
They just didn't explain exactly how they did this.
But last week, and with the help of a friend, I figured out how to do this, and I have now modified both of my Boss RE-20 pedals!

I plan to use a [Disaster Area micro.clock](https://www.disasterareadesigns.com/shop/p/micro-clock), but any other tap tempo pedal that supports 'normally open' operation should work.

This modification will even allow an RE-20 to act as a tap tempo pedal master for another delay pedal that supports 'normally open' tap tempo.
By tapping a tempo on your RE-20 you can set the tempo for the RE-20 and another delay pedal, so if you just want to sync two pedals, all you need is a simple patch cable.

You'll also be able to still change the tempo using the RE-20's built-in tap tempo pedal.
This mod is a total win!
